  teaser: "Ezra Pound\u2019s colossal work of modernist poetry, The Cantos, runs to nearly 800 pages and took him over half his life to write \u2013 and even then, he never finished it. Is The Cantos a masterpiece of twentieth-century poetry or an artistic failure? Is it sheer self-indulgent verbiage or an under-read and underappreciated epic for the modern world? We can hardly scratch the surface in this short introduction to Pound\u2019s Cantos, but we\u2019re going to address some of the key aspects of the poem and offer an analysis of its overall aims and features."

  teaser: "Ezra Pound referred to The Cantos as, variously, \u2018an epic including history\u2019 and, with more muted self-praise, a \u2018ragbag\u2019. Yet although it is undeniably a ragbag, there are a number of key themes running through The Cantos. Pound has started out with Imagism, in 1912, and the idea of \u2018superposition\u2019: placing, as it were, one image on top of another, so that in his most famous early poem, the two-line \u2018In a Station of the Metro\u2019, the faces of the commuters in the Metro station are placed next to the image of petals on the wet, black bough of a tree. In a sense, The Cantos sets out to apply such a principle, not to individual images, but to whole epochs and systems: capitalism, history, politics, economics, art, poetry, and the relation between these various disciplines and institutions. For instance, art and finance are connected through a theme that is glimpsed at several points in The Cantos, namely the relationship between an artist and his patron."

  teaser: "The Cantos evolved into the huge tome it became, with various sections being published piecemeal over the decades, as Pound wrote them. Pound began work on The Cantos in 1915, and the first three Cantos were published in Poetry magazine in 1917. Over the ensuing decades, Pound would rewrite the beginning to the poem, and The Cantos would follow various threads. The most celebrated of these are the Pisan Cantos, which Pound began following his arrest in Italy in May 1945, and his detainment in the American Disciplinary Training Center just north of Pisa. For a short while, Pound slept on the ground in the open air, before being transferred to an open-air cage. He was denied access to his reading, but he continued to write \u2013 he appears to have drafted the first Pisan Cantos on toilet paper."

  teaser: "Although Ezra Pound\u2019s name has been tarnished by his antisemitism \u2013 something he later admitted, and disowned, albeit too late \u2013 The Cantos actually contains barely any trace of his anti-Semitic beliefs, although it does explore Pound\u2019s views of usury and finance, which are related to his views on Jewish people. Many readers may be put off reading The Cantos by Pound\u2019s anti-Semitic views; others may be put off because they find the work impenetrable, even unreadable."

  teaser: "The Cantos is also a ragbag in terms of its geographical range: it\u2019s a truly international poem, containing numerous languages including Italian (two of the Cantos, LXXII and LXXIII, are written entirely in that language), Latin quotations, and Chinese characters, as well as focusing on the history of East Asia, Africa, the beginning of the United States of America in the eighteenth century, as well as medieval Italy. To an extent, Pound\u2019s intention is to draw parallels between these different historical and geographical cultures and histories. Pound\u2019s own analogy for his poetry was that of the iron filings and the magnet: although the iron filings do not form a solid shape themselves, when brought into contact with a magnet they can be made to form shapes. It\u2019s also a highly allusive work, like T. S. Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land and Pound\u2019s own earlier poem, Hugh Selwyn Mauberley. The Cantos alludes to, among many others, the works of Homer, Ovid, Dante, Omar Khayy\xE1m (author of the Persian Rub\xE1iy\xE1t, or \u2018quatrains\u2019, later translated into English by the Victorian poet Edward FitzGerald), Robert Browning, and many, many others. It\u2019s as if Pound is saying that, in order to respond to modern culture and the contemporary world, one must first study the past and look for patterns \u2013 and the same is true of past literature."

  teaser: "The Cantos evolved into the huge tome it became, with various sections being published piecemeal over the decades, as Pound wrote them. Pound began work on The Cantos in 1915, and the first three Cantos were published in Poetry magazine in 1917. Over the ensuing decades, Pound would rewrite the beginning to the poem, and The Cantos would follow various threads. The most celebrated of these are the Pisan Cantos, which Pound began following his arrest in Italy in May 1945, and his detainment in the American Disciplinary Training Center just north of Pisa. For a short while, Pound slept on the ground in the open air, before being transferred to an open-air cage. He was denied access to his reading, but he continued to write \u2013 he appears to have drafted the first Pisan Cantos on toilet paper."

  teaser: "Ezra Pound referred to The Cantos as, variously, \u2018an epic including history\u2019 and, with more muted self-praise, a \u2018ragbag\u2019. Yet although it is undeniably a ragbag, there are a number of key themes running through The Cantos. Pound has started out with Imagism, in 1912, and the idea of \u2018superposition\u2019: placing, as it were, one image on top of another, so that in his most famous early poem, the two-line \u2018In a Station of the Metro\u2019, the faces of the commuters in the Metro station are placed next to the image of petals on the wet, black bough of a tree. In a sense, The Cantos sets out to apply such a principle, not to individual images, but to whole epochs and systems: capitalism, history, politics, economics, art, poetry, and the relation between these various disciplines and institutions. For instance, art and finance are connected through a theme that is glimpsed at several points in The Cantos, namely the relationship between an artist and his patron."

  teaser: "The Cantos evolved into the huge tome it became, with various sections being published piecemeal over the decades, as Pound wrote them. Pound began work on The Cantos in 1915, and the first three Cantos were published in Poetry magazine in 1917. Over the ensuing decades, Pound would rewrite the beginning to the poem, and The Cantos would follow various threads. The most celebrated of these are the Pisan Cantos, which Pound began following his arrest in Italy in May 1945, and his detainment in the American Disciplinary Training Center just north of Pisa. For a short while, Pound slept on the ground in the open air, before being transferred to an open-air cage. He was denied access to his reading, but he continued to write \u2013 he appears to have drafted the first Pisan Cantos on toilet paper."

  teaser: 'Pound was then moved to the United States, where he was charged with treason, but judged unfit to stand trial and incarcerated in a mental hospital, where he would remain until 1958. He died in 1972, having left The Cantos unfinished, and frustrated with his failure to make the poem work. The best place to begin is, perhaps surprisingly in this case, at the beginning, with the first two Cantos; thereafter, highlights include the Pisan Cantos, especially Cantos LXXX-LXXXI (though these are, to an extent, our own personal favourites).

  teaser: "Ezra Pound referred to The Cantos as, variously, \u2018an epic including history\u2019 and, with more muted self-praise, a \u2018ragbag\u2019. Yet although it is undeniably a ragbag, there are a number of key themes running through The Cantos. Pound has started out with Imagism, in 1912, and the idea of \u2018superposition\u2019: placing, as it were, one image on top of another, so that in his most famous early poem, the two-line \u2018In a Station of the Metro\u2019, the faces of the commuters in the Metro station are placed next to the image of petals on the wet, black bough of a tree. In a sense, The Cantos sets out to apply such a principle, not to individual images, but to whole epochs and systems: capitalism, history, politics, economics, art, poetry, and the relation between these various disciplines and institutions. For instance, art and finance are connected through a theme that is glimpsed at several points in The Cantos, namely the relationship between an artist and his patron."

  teaser: "Pound himself said that the structure of The Cantos could be analysed as follows: \u2018Live man goes down into world of dead. \u201CThe repeat in history.\u201D The \u201Cmagic moment\u201D or moment of metamorphosis, bust through from quotidian into \u201Cdivine or permanent world.\u201D Gods, etc.\u2019 This structure can be observed in Canto I, which is an English rendering of a Latin translation of the ancient Greek poem The Odyssey, specifically that section which involves Odysseus and his crew travelling down to Hades, the Underworld. But Pound\u2019s title for his epic, The Cantos, also suggests the medieval Italian poet Dante as a model: his Divine Comedy, comprising numerous \u2018cantos\u2019, is about the poet\u2019s journey into hell, thence to purgatory before arriving in heaven. Pound\u2019s Cantos might be regarded as a modern secular version of Dante\u2019s spiritual journey, provided we don\u2019t view it as solely that."
