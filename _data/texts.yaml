  teaser: "Although Ezra Pound\u2019s name has been tarnished by his antisemitism \u2013 something he later admitted, and disowned, albeit too late \u2013 The Cantos actually contains barely any trace of his anti-Semitic beliefs, although it does explore Pound\u2019s views of usury and finance, which are related to his views on Jewish people. Many readers may be put off reading The Cantos by Pound\u2019s anti-Semitic views; others may be put off because they find the work impenetrable, even unreadable."

  teaser: "The Cantos evolved into the huge tome it became, with various sections being published piecemeal over the decades, as Pound wrote them. Pound began work on The Cantos in 1915, and the first three Cantos were published in Poetry magazine in 1917. Over the ensuing decades, Pound would rewrite the beginning to the poem, and The Cantos would follow various threads. The most celebrated of these are the Pisan Cantos, which Pound began following his arrest in Italy in May 1945, and his detainment in the American Disciplinary Training Center just north of Pisa. For a short while, Pound slept on the ground in the open air, before being transferred to an open-air cage. He was denied access to his reading, but he continued to write \u2013 he appears to have drafted the first Pisan Cantos on toilet paper."

  teaser: "Pound himself said that the structure of The Cantos could be analysed as follows: \u2018Live man goes down into world of dead. \u201CThe repeat in history.\u201D The \u201Cmagic moment\u201D or moment of metamorphosis, bust through from quotidian into \u201Cdivine or permanent world.\u201D Gods, etc.\u2019 This structure can be observed in Canto I, which is an English rendering of a Latin translation of the ancient Greek poem The Odyssey, specifically that section which involves Odysseus and his crew travelling down to Hades, the Underworld. But Pound\u2019s title for his epic, The Cantos, also suggests the medieval Italian poet Dante as a model: his Divine Comedy, comprising numerous \u2018cantos\u2019, is about the poet\u2019s journey into hell, thence to purgatory before arriving in heaven. Pound\u2019s Cantos might be regarded as a modern secular version of Dante\u2019s spiritual journey, provided we don\u2019t view it as solely that."

  teaser: "The Cantos evolved into the huge tome it became, with various sections being published piecemeal over the decades, as Pound wrote them. Pound began work on The Cantos in 1915, and the first three Cantos were published in Poetry magazine in 1917. Over the ensuing decades, Pound would rewrite the beginning to the poem, and The Cantos would follow various threads. The most celebrated of these are the Pisan Cantos, which Pound began following his arrest in Italy in May 1945, and his detainment in the American Disciplinary Training Center just north of Pisa. For a short while, Pound slept on the ground in the open air, before being transferred to an open-air cage. He was denied access to his reading, but he continued to write \u2013 he appears to have drafted the first Pisan Cantos on toilet paper."

  teaser: "Ezra Pound referred to The Cantos as, variously, \u2018an epic including history\u2019 and, with more muted self-praise, a \u2018ragbag\u2019. Yet although it is undeniably a ragbag, there are a number of key themes running through The Cantos. Pound has started out with Imagism, in 1912, and the idea of \u2018superposition\u2019: placing, as it were, one image on top of another, so that in his most famous early poem, the two-line \u2018In a Station of the Metro\u2019, the faces of the commuters in the Metro station are placed next to the image of petals on the wet, black bough of a tree. In a sense, The Cantos sets out to apply such a principle, not to individual images, but to whole epochs and systems: capitalism, history, politics, economics, art, poetry, and the relation between these various disciplines and institutions. For instance, art and finance are connected through a theme that is glimpsed at several points in The Cantos, namely the relationship between an artist and his patron."

  teaser: "Ezra Pound referred to The Cantos as, variously, \u2018an epic including history\u2019 and, with more muted self-praise, a \u2018ragbag\u2019. Yet although it is undeniably a ragbag, there are a number of key themes running through The Cantos. Pound has started out with Imagism, in 1912, and the idea of \u2018superposition\u2019: placing, as it were, one image on top of another, so that in his most famous early poem, the two-line \u2018In a Station of the Metro\u2019, the faces of the commuters in the Metro station are placed next to the image of petals on the wet, black bough of a tree. In a sense, The Cantos sets out to apply such a principle, not to individual images, but to whole epochs and systems: capitalism, history, politics, economics, art, poetry, and the relation between these various disciplines and institutions. For instance, art and finance are connected through a theme that is glimpsed at several points in The Cantos, namely the relationship between an artist and his patron."

  teaser: "The Cantos evolved into the huge tome it became, with various sections being published piecemeal over the decades, as Pound wrote them. Pound began work on The Cantos in 1915, and the first three Cantos were published in Poetry magazine in 1917. Over the ensuing decades, Pound would rewrite the beginning to the poem, and The Cantos would follow various threads. The most celebrated of these are the Pisan Cantos, which Pound began following his arrest in Italy in May 1945, and his detainment in the American Disciplinary Training Center just north of Pisa. For a short while, Pound slept on the ground in the open air, before being transferred to an open-air cage. He was denied access to his reading, but he continued to write \u2013 he appears to have drafted the first Pisan Cantos on toilet paper."

  teaser: "Pound himself said that the structure of The Cantos could be analysed as follows: \u2018Live man goes down into world of dead. \u201CThe repeat in history.\u201D The \u201Cmagic moment\u201D or moment of metamorphosis, bust through from quotidian into \u201Cdivine or permanent world.\u201D Gods, etc.\u2019 This structure can be observed in Canto I, which is an English rendering of a Latin translation of the ancient Greek poem The Odyssey, specifically that section which involves Odysseus and his crew travelling down to Hades, the Underworld. But Pound\u2019s title for his epic, The Cantos, also suggests the medieval Italian poet Dante as a model: his Divine Comedy, comprising numerous \u2018cantos\u2019, is about the poet\u2019s journey into hell, thence to purgatory before arriving in heaven. Pound\u2019s Cantos might be regarded as a modern secular version of Dante\u2019s spiritual journey, provided we don\u2019t view it as solely that."
