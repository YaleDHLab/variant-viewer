To an extent, Pound\u2019s intention is to draw parallels between these different historical and geographical cultures and histories. Pound\u2019s own analogy for his poetry was that of the iron filings and the magnet: although the iron filings do not form a solid shape themselves, when brought into contact with a magnet they can be made to form shapes. It\u2019s also a highly allusive work, like T. S. Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land and Pound\u2019s own earlier poem, Hugh Selwyn Mauberley. The Cantos alludes to, among many others, the works of Homer, Ovid, Dante, Omar Khayy\u00e1m (author of the Persian Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t, or \u2018quatrains\u2019, later translated into English by the Victorian poet Edward FitzGerald), Robert Browning, and many, many others.

To an extent, Pound\u2019s intention is to draw parallels between these different historical and geographical cultures and histories. Pound\u2019s own analogy for his poetry was that of the iron filings and the magnet: although the iron filings do not form a solid shape themselves, when brought into contact with a magnet they can be made to form shapes. It\u2019s also a highly allusive work, like T. S. Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land and Pound\u2019s own earlier poem, Hugh Selwyn Mauberley. The Cantos alludes to, among many others, the works of Homer, Ovid, Dante, Omar Khayy\u00e1m (author of the Persian Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t, or \u2018quatrains\u2019, later translated into English by the Victorian poet Edward FitzGerald), Robert Browning, and many, many others.
