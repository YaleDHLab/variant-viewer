"text_id_6", "teaser": "The Cantos is also a ragbag in terms of its geographical range: it\u2019s a truly international poem, containing numerous languages including Italian (two of the Cantos, LXXII and LXXIII, are written entirely in that language), Latin quotations, and Chinese characters, as well as focusing on the history of East Asia, Africa, the beginning of the United States of America in the eighteenth century, as well as medieval Italy. To an extent, Pound\u2019s intention is to draw parallels between these different historical and geographical cultures and histories. Pound\u2019s own analogy for his poetry was that of the iron filings and the magnet: although the iron filings do not form a solid shape themselves, when brought into contact with a magnet they can be made to form shapes. It\u2019s also a highly allusive work, like T. S. Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land and Pound\u2019s own earlier poem, Hugh Selwyn Mauberley. The Cantos alludes to, among many others, the works of Homer, Ovid, Dante, Omar Khayy\u00e1m (author of the Persian Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t, or \u2018quatrains\u2019, later translated into English by the Victorian poet Edward FitzGerald), Robert Browning, and many, many others. It\u2019s as if Pound is saying that, in order to respond to modern culture and the contemporary world, one must first study the past and look for patterns \u2013 and the same is true of past literature.", "cover_image": "/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592952_quarter.jpg", "title": "Stone Branches Sails", "genetic_data": {"sections": [{"section_title": "Sails Moss Branches", "lines": [{"line": "Circe\u2019s this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.

Yet although it is undeniably a ragbag, there are a number of key themes running through The Cantos. Pound has started out with Imagism, in 1912, and the idea of \u2018superposition\u2019: placing, as it were, one image on top of another, so that in his most famous early poem, the two-line \u2018In a Station of the Metro\u2019, the faces of the commuters in the Metro station are placed next to the image of petals on the wet, black bough of a tree. In a sense, The Cantos sets out to apply such a principle, not to individual images, but to whole epochs and systems: capitalism, history, politics, economics, art, poetry, and the relation between these various disciplines and institutions. For instance, art and finance are connected through a theme that is glimpsed at several points in The Cantos, namely the relationship between an artist and his patron.", "cover_image": "/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/1458077_quarter.jpg", "title": "Sails Branches Branches", "genetic_data": {"sections": [{"section_title": "Moss Tree", "lines": [{"line": "Pitiful spirit.

Yet although it is undeniably a ragbag, there are a number of key themes running through The Cantos. Pound has started out with Imagism, in 1912, and the idea of \u2018superposition\u2019: placing, as it were, one image on top of another, so that in his most famous early poem, the two-line \u2018In a Station of the Metro\u2019, the faces of the commuters in the Metro station are placed next to the image of petals on the wet, black bough of a tree. In a sense, The Cantos sets out to apply such a principle, not to individual images, but to whole epochs and systems: capitalism, history, politics, economics, art, poetry, and the relation between these various disciplines and institutions. For instance, art and finance are connected through a theme that is glimpsed at several points in The Cantos, namely the relationship between an artist and his patron.", "cover_image": "/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592936_quarter.jpg", "title": "Sails Stone Stone", "genetic_data": {"sections": [{"section_title": "Ship Ship Moss Tree", "lines": [{"line": "Till I should hear Tiresias.", "variants": [{"line_variant": "Till And should sat Tiresias.", "references": [{"footnotes": ["VII.62"], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592945_quarter.jpg"]}]}, {"line_variant": "Till other. heaping hear Tiresias.", "references": [{"footnotes": ["IV.4"], "images": []}, {"footnotes": ["IV.4"], "images": []}]}]}, {"line": "And drawing sword from my hip", "variants": []}, {"line": "I dug the ell-square pitkin;", "variants": [{"line_variant": "I cried with ell-square pitkin;", "references": [{"footnotes": ["VI.12"], "images": []}]}, {"line_variant": "I dug sun-rays then pitkin;", "references": [{"footnotes": ["III.78"], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592940_quarter.jpg"]}]}]}, {"line": "Limbs that we left in the house of Circe,", "variants": [{"line_variant": "Limbs that sickly left in the house of Circe,", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": []}]}, {"line_variant": "Limbs that we left spirit. the house of Circe,", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592956_quarter.jpg"]}]}, {"line_variant": "Limbs that Pluto left and the house of Circe,", "references": [{"footnotes": ["III.78"], "images": []}]}]}, {"line": "Sun to his slumber, shadows o\u2019er all the ocean,", "variants": [{"line_variant": "Sun to had slumber, shadows o\u2019er all tiller, ocean,", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592942_quarter.jpg"]}]}, {"line_variant": "Sun to his slumber, shadows a the the ocean,", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592945_quarter.jpg"]}]}]}, {"line": "Sun to his slumber, shadows o\u2019er all the ocean,", "variants": []}, {"line": "I sat to keep off the impetuous impotent dead,", "variants": []}, {"line": "Thus with stretched sail, we went over sea till day\u2019s end.

Yet although it is undeniably a ragbag, there are a number of key themes running through The Cantos. Pound has started out with Imagism, in 1912, and the idea of \u2018superposition\u2019: placing, as it were, one image on top of another, so that in his most famous early poem, the two-line \u2018In a Station of the Metro\u2019, the faces of the commuters in the Metro station are placed next to the image of petals on the wet, black bough of a tree. In a sense, The Cantos sets out to apply such a principle, not to individual images, but to whole epochs and systems: capitalism, history, politics, economics, art, poetry, and the relation between these various disciplines and institutions. For instance, art and finance are connected through a theme that is glimpsed at several points in The Cantos, namely the relationship between an artist and his patron.", "cover_image": "/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592939_quarter.jpg", "title": "River Ship", "genetic_data": {"sections": [{"section_title": "Ship Sails", "lines": [{"line": "The ocean flowing backward, came we then to the place", "variants": [{"line_variant": "The ocean many, backward, came we Unburied, to the place", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/1458079_quarter.jpg"]}, {"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592950_quarter.jpg"]}]}, {"line_variant": "The ocean with backward, out Thus then to the place", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": []}]}]}, {"line": "Here did they rites, Perimedes and Eurylochus, ", "variants": [{"line_variant": "Here mast they rites, Perimedes and Eurylochus, ", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": []}]}]}, {"line": "With glitter of sun-rays", "variants": [{"line_variant": "With glitter of sun-rays", "references": [{"footnotes": ["IV.4"], "images": []}, {"footnotes": ["IV.4"], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592945_quarter.jpg"]}]}]}, {"line": "To Pluto the strong, and praised Proserpine; ", "variants": [{"line_variant": "To sail, the strong, about praised on ", "references": [{"footnotes": ["II.342"], "images": []}, {"footnotes": ["VII.62"], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592947_quarter.jpg"]}]}, {"line_variant": "To Pluto the strong, hurried over Proserpine; ", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592932_quarter.jpg"]}, {"footnotes": ["II.342"], "images": []}]}, {"line_variant": "To onward the strong, more many Proserpine; ", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": []}]}]}, {"line": "Then sat we amidships, wind jamming the tiller,", "variants": [{"line_variant": "Then sat \u201cElpenor, amidships, wind sword the tiller,", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592951_quarter.jpg"]}]}]}, {"line": "\u201cElpenor, how art thou come to this dark coast?", "variants": [{"line_variant": "\u201cElpenor, Poured art beasts; aboard upon this dark coast?", "references": [{"footnotes": ["IV.4"], "images": []}, {"footnotes": ["IV.4"], "images": []}]}]}, {"line": "Unburied, cast on the wide earth,", "variants": []}, {"line": "Swartest night stretched over wretched men there.
