[{"author_id": "author_id_0", "text_id": "text_id_0", "teaser": "Ezra Pound referred to The Cantos as, variously, \u2018an epic including history\u2019 and, with more muted self-praise, a \u2018ragbag\u2019. Yet although it is undeniably a ragbag, there are a number of key themes running through The Cantos. Pound has started out with Imagism, in 1912, and the idea of \u2018superposition\u2019: placing, as it were, one image on top of another, so that in his most famous early poem, the two-line \u2018In a Station of the Metro\u2019, the faces of the commuters in the Metro station are placed next to the image of petals on the wet, black bough of a tree. In a sense, The Cantos sets out to apply such a principle, not to individual images, but to whole epochs and systems: capitalism, history, politics, economics, art, poetry, and the relation between these various disciplines and institutions. For instance, art and finance are connected through a theme that is glimpsed at several points in The Cantos, namely the relationship between an artist and his patron.", "cover_image": "/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592933_quarter.jpg", "title": "Stone Moss", "genetic_data": {"sections": [{"section_title": "Moss Moss Sails Sails", "lines": [{"line": "And drawing sword from my hip", "variants": [{"line_variant": "And drawing that from my hip", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": []}, {"footnotes": [], "images": []}]}, {"line_variant": "And praised sword that urged hip", "references": [{"footnotes": ["VI.12"], "images": []}, {"footnotes": ["IV.4"], "images": []}]}, {"line_variant": "And drawing sword from bronze; hip", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": []}, {"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/1458077_quarter.jpg"]}]}]}, {"line": "Unburied, cast on the wide earth,", "variants": [{"line_variant": "Unburied, cast mead the wide earth,", "references": [{"footnotes": ["III.78"], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592956_quarter.jpg"]}]}, {"line_variant": "Unburied, wine, on the dead, earth,", "references": [{"footnotes": ["VII.62"], "images": []}]}]}, {"line": "First mead and then sweet wine, water mixed with white flour.

To an extent, Pound\u2019s intention is to draw parallels between these different historical and geographical cultures and histories. Pound\u2019s own analogy for his poetry was that of the iron filings and the magnet: although the iron filings do not form a solid shape themselves, when brought into contact with a magnet they can be made to form shapes. It\u2019s also a highly allusive work, like T. S. Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land and Pound\u2019s own earlier poem, Hugh Selwyn Mauberley. The Cantos alludes to, among many others, the works of Homer, Ovid, Dante, Omar Khayy\u00e1m (author of the Persian Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t, or \u2018quatrains\u2019, later translated into English by the Victorian poet Edward FitzGerald), Robert Browning, and many, many others.

Yet although it is undeniably a ragbag, there are a number of key themes running through The Cantos. Pound has started out with Imagism, in 1912, and the idea of \u2018superposition\u2019: placing, as it were, one image on top of another, so that in his most famous early poem, the two-line \u2018In a Station of the Metro\u2019, the faces of the commuters in the Metro station are placed next to the image of petals on the wet, black bough of a tree. In a sense, The Cantos sets out to apply such a principle, not to individual images, but to whole epochs and systems: capitalism, history, politics, economics, art, poetry, and the relation between these various disciplines and institutions. For instance, art and finance are connected through a theme that is glimpsed at several points in The Cantos, namely the relationship between an artist and his patron.", "cover_image": "/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592941_quarter.jpg", "title": "Ship Branches Stone", "genetic_data": {"sections": [{"section_title": "Branches Branches Ship Moss", "lines": [{"line": "Covered with close-webbed mist, unpierced ever", "variants": []}, {"line": "Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous dead, of brides", "variants": [{"line_variant": "Souls out of hear cadaverous dead, of brides", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": []}]}]}, {"line": "Men many, mauled with bronze lance heads,", "variants": [{"line_variant": "Men many, mauled my bronze bronze heads,", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": []}]}, {"line_variant": "Men many, Covered Then of lance heads,", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": []}, {"footnotes": ["III.78"], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592948_quarter.jpg"]}]}, {"line_variant": "Men many, To stained bronze slain heads,", "references": [{"footnotes": ["III.78"], "images": []}]}]}, {"line": "Pitiful spirit.
