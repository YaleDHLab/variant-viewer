Yet although it is undeniably a ragbag, there are a number of key themes running through The Cantos. Pound has started out with Imagism, in 1912, and the idea of \u2018superposition\u2019: placing, as it were, one image on top of another, so that in his most famous early poem, the two-line \u2018In a Station of the Metro\u2019, the faces of the commuters in the Metro station are placed next to the image of petals on the wet, black bough of a tree. In a sense, The Cantos sets out to apply such a principle, not to individual images, but to whole epochs and systems: capitalism, history, politics, economics, art, poetry, and the relation between these various disciplines and institutions. For instance, art and finance are connected through a theme that is glimpsed at several points in The Cantos, namely the relationship between an artist and his patron.", "cover_image": "/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592940_quarter.jpg", "title": "River Moss River", "genetic_data": {"sections": [{"section_title": "Branches Branches", "lines": [{"line": "I sat to keep off the impetuous impotent dead,", "variants": [{"line_variant": "I sat to also forth the impetuous impotent dead,", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592946_quarter.jpg"]}, {"footnotes": [], "images": []}]}, {"line_variant": "I sat to cried off the sweet then dead,", "references": [{"footnotes": ["VI.12"], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592958_quarter.jpg"]}]}]}, {"line": "Battle spoil, bearing yet dreory arms, ", "variants": [{"line_variant": "Battle spoil, men yet stretched Covered ", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/1458077_quarter.jpg"]}]}]}, {"line": "For sacrifice, heaping the pyre with goods, ", "variants": [{"line_variant": "For sacrifice, men lands, pyre with goods, ", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": []}]}, {"line_variant": "For dark heaping the pyre A goods, ", "references": [{"footnotes": ["II.342"], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592933_quarter.jpg"]}]}, {"line_variant": "For sheep heaping the pyre godly goods, ", "references": [{"footnotes": ["VI.12"], "images": []}]}]}, {"line": "Unsheathed the narrow sword,", "variants": [{"line_variant": "Unsheathed the narrow sword,", "references": [{"footnotes": ["III.78"], "images": []}, {"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592953_quarter.jpg"]}]}, {"line_variant": "Unsheathed the narrow sword,", "references": [{"footnotes": ["VII.62"], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592935_quarter.jpg"]}]}]}, {"line": "As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best", "variants": [{"line_variant": "As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of much;

Yet although it is undeniably a ragbag, there are a number of key themes running through The Cantos. Pound has started out with Imagism, in 1912, and the idea of \u2018superposition\u2019: placing, as it were, one image on top of another, so that in his most famous early poem, the two-line \u2018In a Station of the Metro\u2019, the faces of the commuters in the Metro station are placed next to the image of petals on the wet, black bough of a tree. In a sense, The Cantos sets out to apply such a principle, not to individual images, but to whole epochs and systems: capitalism, history, politics, economics, art, poetry, and the relation between these various disciplines and institutions. For instance, art and finance are connected through a theme that is glimpsed at several points in The Cantos, namely the relationship between an artist and his patron.", "cover_image": "/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592932_quarter.jpg", "title": "River Tree Ship", "genetic_data": {"sections": [{"section_title": "Ship Ship", "lines": [{"line": "To the Kimmerian lands, and peopled cities", "variants": []}, {"line": "These many crowded about me; with shouting,", "variants": [{"line_variant": "These many of about me; the shouting,", "references": [{"footnotes": ["VI.12"], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592937_quarter.jpg"]}, {"footnotes": [], "images": []}]}]}, {"line": "The ocean flowing backward, came we then to the place", "variants": []}, {"line": "Unsheathed the narrow sword,", "variants": [{"line_variant": "Unsheathed the narrow sword,", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592956_quarter.jpg"]}, {"footnotes": ["II.342"], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592945_quarter.jpg"]}]}, {"line_variant": "Unsheathed the narrow sword,", "references": [{"footnotes": ["II.342"], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592949_quarter.jpg"]}, {"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592956_quarter.jpg"]}]}]}, {"line": "Slaughtered the herds, sheep slain of bronze;", "variants": []}, {"line": "As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the best", "variants": []}, {"line": "The ocean flowing backward, came we then to the place", "variants": [{"line_variant": "The keel flowing backward, came and then to the place", "references": [{"footnotes": ["III.78"], "images": []}, {"footnotes": ["IV.4"], "images": ["/utils/seed-resources/seed-images/manuscript/11592952_quarter.jpg"]}]}]}, {"line": "We set up mast and sail on that swart ship,", "variants": [{"line_variant": "We the up mast and sail on tiller, Thus ship,", "references": [{"footnotes": ["III.78"], "images": []}]}]}, {"line": "Circe\u2019s this craft, the trim-coifed goddess.
