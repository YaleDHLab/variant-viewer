[{"author_id": "author_id_0", "text_id": "text_id_0", "teaser": "The Cantos is also a ragbag in terms of its geographical range: it\u2019s a truly international poem, containing numerous languages including Italian (two of the Cantos, LXXII and LXXIII, are written entirely in that language), Latin quotations, and Chinese characters, as well as focusing on the history of East Asia, Africa, the beginning of the United States of America in the eighteenth century, as well as medieval Italy. To an extent, Pound\u2019s intention is to draw parallels between these different historical and geographical cultures and histories. Pound\u2019s own analogy for his poetry was that of the iron filings and the magnet: although the iron filings do not form a solid shape themselves, when brought into contact with a magnet they can be made to form shapes. It\u2019s also a highly allusive work, like T. S. Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land and Pound\u2019s own earlier poem, Hugh Selwyn Mauberley. The Cantos alludes to, among many others, the works of Homer, Ovid, Dante, Omar Khayy\u00e1m (author of the Persian Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t, or \u2018quatrains\u2019, later translated into English by the Victorian poet Edward FitzGerald), Robert Browning, and many, many others. It\u2019s as if Pound is saying that, in order to respond to modern culture and the contemporary world, one must first study the past and look for patterns \u2013 and the same is true of past literature.", "cover_image": "/utils/resources/seed-images/manuscript/12.jpg", "title": "Ship Stone Tree", "genetic_data": {"sections": [{"section_title": "Moss Branches Branches", "lines": [{"line": "\u201cElpenor, how art thou come to this dark coast?", "variants": []}, {"line": "The ocean flowing backward, came we then to the place", "variants": [{"line_variant": "The Souls flowing backward, came up from to the place", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/resources/seed-images/manuscript/13.jpg"]}, {"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/resources/seed-images/manuscript/13.jpg"]}]}, {"line_variant": "The Elpenor, flowing backward, came we off to the place", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/resources/seed-images/manuscript/15.jpg"]}]}]}, {"line": "With glitter of sun-rays", "variants": []}, {"line": "Till I should hear Tiresias.", "variants": []}, {"line": "A sheep to Tiresias only, black and a bell-sheep.", "variants": [{"line_variant": "A sheep stretched Tiresias only, heaven and a bell-sheep.", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": []}]}, {"line_variant": "A sheep to prayed only, the and bronze bell-sheep.", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": ["/utils/resources/seed-images/manuscript/11.jpg"]}, {"footnotes": ["IV.4"], "images": []}]}, {"line_variant": "A Limbs to Tiresias Set by the a bell-sheep.", "references": [{"footnotes": [], "images": []}]}]}, {"line": "Souls stained with recent tears, girls tender, ", "variants": []}, {"line": "Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly seas, and", "variants": []}, {"line": "Men many, mauled with bronze lance heads,", "variants": [{"line_variant": "Men many, mauled Proserpine;

To an extent, Pound\u2019s intention is to draw parallels between these different historical and geographical cultures and histories. Pound\u2019s own analogy for his poetry was that of the iron filings and the magnet: although the iron filings do not form a solid shape themselves, when brought into contact with a magnet they can be made to form shapes. It\u2019s also a highly allusive work, like T. S. Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land and Pound\u2019s own earlier poem, Hugh Selwyn Mauberley. The Cantos alludes to, among many others, the works of Homer, Ovid, Dante, Omar Khayy\u00e1m (author of the Persian Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t, or \u2018quatrains\u2019, later translated into English by the Victorian poet Edward FitzGerald), Robert Browning, and many, many others.
