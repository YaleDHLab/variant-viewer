    <div class='intro-teaser'>The Cantos is also a ragbag in terms of its geographical range: it’s a truly international poem, containing numerous languages including Italian (two of the Cantos, LXXII and LXXIII, are written entirely in that language), Latin quotations, and Chinese characters, as well as focusing on the history of East Asia, Africa, the beginning of the United States of America in the eighteenth century, as well as medieval Italy. To an extent, Pound’s intention is to draw parallels between these different historical and geographical cultures and histories. Pound’s own analogy for his poetry was that of the iron filings and the magnet: although the iron filings do not form a solid shape themselves, when brought into contact with a magnet they can be made to form shapes. It’s also a highly allusive work, like T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land and Pound’s own earlier poem, Hugh Selwyn Mauberley. The Cantos alludes to, among many others, the works of Homer, Ovid, Dante, Omar Khayyám (author of the Persian Rubáiyát, or ‘quatrains’, later translated into English by the Victorian poet Edward FitzGerald), Robert Browning, and many, many others. It’s as if Pound is saying that, in order to respond to modern culture and the contemporary world, one must first study the past and look for patterns – and the same is true of past literature.</div>
